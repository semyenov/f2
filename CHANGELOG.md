## [3.0.0] - 2025-01-29

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

This release introduces a complete module restructure for better organization, tree-shaking, and developer experience. All import paths have changed. See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed upgrade instructions.

### Added

- **Hierarchical Module Structure**: New 5-category organization for clearer separation of concerns
  - `runtime/` - Core functionality always needed at runtime
  - `federation/` - Federation-specific features
  - `infrastructure/` - Production features (resilience, performance)
  - `api/` - User-facing APIs (simple facade, advanced patterns)
  - `tooling/` - Development and deployment tools

- **Improved Tree-Shaking**: Modular exports allow bundlers to exclude unused code
  - Runtime-only builds: ~50KB
  - Full production builds: ~120KB (excluding tooling)
  - Development tools not included in production bundles

- **Migration Documentation**:
  - Comprehensive migration guide (MIGRATION.md)
  - Quick reference for new imports (QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
  - Release checklist for maintainers

### Changed

- **Import Paths** (Breaking):
  - `@cqrs/federation/core` â†’ `@cqrs/federation/runtime`
  - `@cqrs/federation/experimental` â†’ `@cqrs/federation/api/advanced`
  - `@cqrs/federation/facade` â†’ `@cqrs/federation/api/simple`
  - `@cqrs/federation/cli` â†’ `@cqrs/federation/tooling/cli`
  - All internal imports updated to new structure

- **Package Exports**: Reduced from 27 to 21 cleaner, more organized exports
- **Build Configuration**: Updated tsdown and TypeScript configs for new structure
- **Test Organization**: Tests updated to use new import paths

### Fixed

- Circular dependency issues resolved with new structure
- Unclear boundaries between runtime and development code
- Bundle size optimization through better module separation
