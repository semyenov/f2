# Security Checklist

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the Apollo Federation v2 framework.

## Dependencies Security ✅

- [x] Regular dependency audits via `bun audit`
- [x] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [x] Node.js version targeting (>=20.0.0) for latest security patches
- [x] Lock file (`bun.lock`) committed to prevent supply chain attacks

## Code Security Practices ✅

- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Input validation through Effect Schema
- [x] Comprehensive error handling without information leakage
- [x] ESLint rules for security best practices

## GraphQL Security Considerations 🔄

- [ ] Query complexity analysis (implement in performance module)
- [ ] Query depth limiting (implement in performance module)
- [ ] Rate limiting capabilities (implement in error boundaries)
- [ ] Input sanitization for schema definitions
- [x] Type-safe resolver implementations

## Federation Security Features ✅

- [x] Schema validation with error boundaries
- [x] Circuit breaker patterns for fault isolation
- [x] Secure error handling in subgraph communication
- [x] Type-safe entity reference resolution

## Production Security Recommendations 📋

### Environment Configuration

```typescript
// Secure configuration patterns
const config = {
  // Never expose internal error details in production
  exposeErrors: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',

  // Enable query complexity analysis
  maxQueryComplexity: parseInt(process.env.MAX_QUERY_COMPLEXITY || '1000'),

  // Set reasonable timeouts
  subgraphTimeout: parseInt(process.env.SUBGRAPH_TIMEOUT || '5000'),

  // Enable security headers
  securityHeaders: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
}
```

### Schema Security

- Validate all input schemas before processing
- Sanitize schema definitions from external sources
- Use whitelist approach for allowed directives
- Implement proper authorization checks for schema evolution

### Network Security

- Use HTTPS for all subgraph communication
- Implement proper authentication for subgraph endpoints
- Configure CORS policies appropriately
- Enable rate limiting at the gateway level

### Error Handling Security

```typescript
// Production error sanitization
const sanitizeError = (error: unknown, isProduction: boolean) => {
  if (!isProduction) {
    return error
  }

  // In production, only expose safe error messages
  return {
    message: 'An error occurred',
    code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
  }
}
```

## Security Testing 🧪

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Input validation edge cases
- [ ] Error handling boundary conditions
- [ ] Authentication/authorization logic
- [ ] Schema validation security

### Integration Tests

- [ ] End-to-end security flows
- [ ] Cross-service communication security
- [ ] Error propagation containment
- [ ] Performance under attack scenarios

### Penetration Testing

- [ ] GraphQL query injection attempts
- [ ] Schema introspection attacks
- [ ] Batch query abuse scenarios
- [ ] Resource exhaustion attacks

## Monitoring & Alerting 📊

### Security Metrics to Track

- Failed authentication attempts
- Query complexity violations
- Rate limit violations
- Unusual error patterns
- Subgraph communication failures

### Alert Conditions

- High error rates (>5% in 5 minutes)
- Query complexity spikes
- Authentication failures spike
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Dependency vulnerability alerts

## Compliance Considerations 📜

### Data Protection

- Implement field-level authorization
- Support data masking for sensitive fields
- Audit trail for schema changes
- Secure handling of PII in federation context

### Regulatory Compliance

- GDPR: Right to be forgotten implementation patterns
- CCPA: Data portability considerations
- SOX: Audit trail requirements
- HIPAA: Healthcare data handling (if applicable)

## Security Review Process 🔍

### Code Review Security Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Authorization checks in place
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] Security tests cover changes

### Regular Security Audits

- Monthly dependency audits
- Quarterly security architecture review
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous security monitoring

## Incident Response 🚨

### Security Incident Types

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Follow security advisory guidelines
2. **Code Vulnerabilities**: Immediate patching and disclosure process
3. **Runtime Attacks**: Circuit breaker activation and traffic analysis
4. **Data Breaches**: Incident response team activation

### Response Timeline

- Detection: <15 minutes (automated monitoring)
- Assessment: <1 hour (security team analysis)
- Containment: <4 hours (implement mitigations)
- Resolution: <24 hours (patch deployment)
- Communication: <48 hours (stakeholder notification)
