# Security Checklist

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the Apollo Federation v2 framework.

## Dependencies Security ✅

- [x] Regular dependency audits via `bun audit`
- [x] Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- [x] Node.js version targeting (>=20.0.0) for latest security patches
- [x] Lock file (`bun.lock`) committed to prevent supply chain attacks

## Code Security Practices ✅

- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled
- [x] No hardcoded secrets in source code
- [x] Input validation through Effect Schema
- [x] Comprehensive error handling without information leakage
- [x] ESLint rules for security best practices

## GraphQL Security Considerations ✅

- [x] Query complexity analysis (available in PerformanceOptimizations module)
- [x] Query depth limiting (configurable in OptimizedExecutor)
- [x] Rate limiting capabilities (implemented in FederationErrorBoundaries)
- [x] Input sanitization for schema definitions (Effect Schema validation)
- [x] Type-safe resolver implementations (SafeResolverMap utility types)

## Federation Security Features ✅

- [x] Schema validation with error boundaries
- [x] Circuit breaker patterns for fault isolation
- [x] Secure error handling in subgraph communication
- [x] Type-safe entity reference resolution

## Production Security Recommendations 📋

### Environment Configuration

```typescript
// Secure configuration patterns
const config = {
  // Never expose internal error details in production
  exposeErrors: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',

  // Enable query complexity analysis
  maxQueryComplexity: parseInt(process.env.MAX_QUERY_COMPLEXITY || '1000'),

  // Set reasonable timeouts
  subgraphTimeout: parseInt(process.env.SUBGRAPH_TIMEOUT || '5000'),

  // Enable security headers
  securityHeaders: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
}
```

### Schema Security

- ✅ Validate all input schemas before processing (Effect Schema validation)
- ✅ Sanitize schema definitions from external sources (ASTConversion with strict mode)
- ✅ Use whitelist approach for allowed directives (Ultra-strict entity builder)
- ✅ Implement proper authorization checks for schema evolution (SchemaEvolution module)

### Network Security

- ✅ Use HTTPS for all subgraph communication (ServiceDefinition configuration)
- ✅ Implement proper authentication for subgraph endpoints (Connection headers support)
- ✅ Configure CORS policies appropriately (Service configuration)
- ✅ Enable rate limiting at the gateway level (FederationErrorBoundaries with rate limiting)

### Error Handling Security

```typescript
// Production error sanitization
const sanitizeError = (error: unknown, isProduction: boolean) => {
  if (!isProduction) {
    return error
  }

  // In production, only expose safe error messages
  return {
    message: 'An error occurred',
    code: 'INTERNAL_ERROR',
  }
}
```

## Security Testing ✅

### Unit Tests

- ✅ Input validation edge cases (Effect Schema property-based tests)
- ✅ Error handling boundary conditions (Pattern matching exhaustiveness)
- ✅ Authentication/authorization logic (Resolver context validation)
- ✅ Schema validation security (AST conversion strict mode tests)

### Integration Tests

- ✅ End-to-end security flows (Federation composition tests)
- ✅ Cross-service communication security (Connection pool tests)
- ✅ Error propagation containment (Error boundary integration tests)
- ✅ Performance under attack scenarios (Circuit breaker load tests)

### Penetration Testing

- ✅ GraphQL query injection attempts (Input sanitization tests)
- ✅ Schema introspection attacks (Query complexity limiting)
- ✅ Batch query abuse scenarios (DataLoader rate limiting)
- ✅ Resource exhaustion attacks (Memory management and timeouts)

## Monitoring & Alerting 📊

### Security Metrics to Track

- ✅ Failed authentication attempts (PerformanceOptimizations metrics)
- ✅ Query complexity violations (OptimizedExecutor monitoring)
- ✅ Rate limit violations (FederationErrorBoundaries metrics)
- ✅ Unusual error patterns (ErrorMatching analytics)
- ✅ Subgraph communication failures (SubgraphManagement health monitoring)

### Alert Conditions

- High error rates (>5% in 5 minutes)
- Query complexity spikes
- Authentication failures spike
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Dependency vulnerability alerts

## Compliance Considerations 📜

### Data Protection

- Implement field-level authorization
- Support data masking for sensitive fields
- Audit trail for schema changes
- Secure handling of PII in federation context

### Regulatory Compliance

- GDPR: Right to be forgotten implementation patterns
- CCPA: Data portability considerations
- SOX: Audit trail requirements
- HIPAA: Healthcare data handling (if applicable)

## Security Review Process 🔍

### Code Review Security Checklist

- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Authorization checks in place
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] Security tests cover changes

### Regular Security Audits

- Monthly dependency audits
- Quarterly security architecture review
- Annual penetration testing
- Continuous security monitoring

## Incident Response 🚨

### Security Incident Types

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Follow security advisory guidelines
2. **Code Vulnerabilities**: Immediate patching and disclosure process
3. **Runtime Attacks**: Circuit breaker activation and traffic analysis
4. **Data Breaches**: Incident response team activation

### Response Timeline

- Detection: <15 minutes (automated monitoring)
- Assessment: <1 hour (security team analysis)
- Containment: <4 hours (implement mitigations)
- Resolution: <24 hours (patch deployment)
- Communication: <48 hours (stakeholder notification)
